# Logseq Backlog

A LogSeq plugin to manage your backlogs.

This is mostly specific to my workflow where I maintain a page `Backlog/...` for each project and from time to time (usually once a week) I go through the backlog and move items to `Backlog/.../Complete` page. This plugin provides a single slash command `/Refile Backlog` to move all the completed items to corresponding the `Backlog/.../Complete` page.

[logseq-plugin-backlog.webm](https://github.com/meain/logseq-plugin-backlog/assets/14259816/81d06c60-6fd7-470b-8e7d-9781cf78ac01)

*Ideally I would have done this outside of logseq with soething like [this bash script](https://github.com/meain/dotfiles/blob/7c0f85ba00c423af6a3ffe8554a340490828776c/scripts/.local/bin/random/%2Clogseq-refile), but the references to a moved item somewhere else in the graph breaks (similar to cutting and pasting a block). This is done to avoid that. [Related issue](https://discuss.logseq.com/t/move-block-to-another-page/6276).*
