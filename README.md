# Logseq Backlog

A LogSeq plugin to manage your backlogs.

This is mostly specific to my workflow where I maintain a page `Backlog/...` for each project and from time to time (usually once a week) I go through the backlog and move items to `Backlog/.../Complete` page. This plugin provides a single slash command `/Refile Backlog` to move all the completed items to corresponding the `Backlog/.../Complete` page.
